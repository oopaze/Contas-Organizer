# Contas Organizer

A Tkinter App made to manage my bills and credit cards using python and Tkinter.

### How to run

At first you need to have the [Python-3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/), the `python3-tk` and the `python3-pip` packages installed. 

Once you installed these two packages, clone this repository with the command below:
```bash
# cloning repository
git clone git@github.com:oopaze/Contas-Organizer.git
```

after clone the repository, enter in the project folder:
```bash
# entering in project folder
cd Contas-Organizer
```

and then install, create and activate a virtual environment (Optional): 
```bash
# instaling the virtual environment module
python3 -m pip install virtualenv

# creating a virtual environment
python3 -m virtualenv .env

# activating the virtual environment
source .env/bin/activate
```
<sup>Why should we use virtual environment in python? [Read more about](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-use-a-virtual-environment-for-every-python-project-c17dab3b0fd0)!</sup>

Now, with our virtual enviroment set, we are able to install all dependencies of our project. To install all dependencies, just run the following command:
```
# installing all the dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If everything goes ok, you project is ready to run just running the `run.py` file like this:
```
# Running application
python run.py
```
